In goes the rabbit, and after a bit of magic, the rabbit turns into a second white dove, and then both doves into a red balloon or a blue silk scarf, and so on. The hat never changes size; however, the contents that go in and come out change their character based on what the magician wants to achieve.

We don't change the size of the hat while we transform the data, that is, we don't change the internal relationships between the data, but we do change their format or the way they are organized. Most often, we change numeric data to different scales, usually between 0 and 1, which is called \"Normalization.'\n","\n","So, when we wrangle data, we transform and map data from one \"raw\" data format (like string, categorical, or numeric) into another format in order to make it usable for a number of analytical purposes.

The same is true for computing hardware: Stuff too many data into a machine that's too small, both in terms of hardware and in terms of memory, and your work grinds to a halt (or worse: Your machine starts smoking, and all the processing causes an electric fire.
